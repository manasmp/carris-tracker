# carris-tracker
Carris Metropolitana public bus arrival tracker

## About This Project
I took big inspiration from the [Transit Tracker Project](https://transit-tracker.eastsideurbanism.org/) but instead of using a LED Display, I'll be making a front-end to display on a normal screen like my CRT TV.

#### Made with:

 - Python
 - [Carris Metropolitana
   API](https://github.com/carrismetropolitana/api)  for real time
   information about the buses.

#### Why ? 
 - I wanted to learn how to interact with APIs, since I've never worked with it before
 - I've had a CRT in my room for years I haven't used in a while. This could also be later added (I hope) to the [Homepage](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage) I'm selfhosting in my local network as a widget.
