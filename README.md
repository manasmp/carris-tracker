# carris-tracker
Carris Metropolitana public bus arrival tracker

## About This Project
I took big inspiration from the [Transit Tracker Project](https://transit-tracker.eastsideurbanism.org/) but instead of using a LED Display, I'll be making a front-end to display on a normal screen like my CRT TV.

#### Made with:

 - Python
 - [Carris Metropolitana
   API](https://github.com/carrismetropolitana/api)  for real time
   information about the buses.
